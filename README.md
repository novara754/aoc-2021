# Advent of Code 2021 ðŸŽ„

Happy holidays!
This repo contains my solutions for the [Advent of Code 2021](https://adventofcode.com/2021).

## Usage

**Note:** Requires [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) to be installed on your machine.

The input of each day is stored in the `data/` directory. The solutions
for each day are stored in the corresponding day in the `src/` directory.

To compile and run all solutions you simply have to execute `cargo run` in your terminal.
**Make sure your current working directory is set this project's root directory**.

Each day also has tests using the puzzles' example inputs and solutions. These can be
run using `cargo test` to ensure the functionality of the solutions.
